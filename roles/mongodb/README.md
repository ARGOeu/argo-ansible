MongoDB Role
=========

MongoDB role sets up mongodb

Requirements
------------

You will need to have the repo `mongodb-org-3.2` on the host.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: mongodb }
